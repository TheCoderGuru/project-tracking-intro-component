## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While doing this challenge, I learnt that you can manipulate the position of an image to the right by negating the value on its ```right``` property.



### Continued development

I plan to continue exploring with the ```right``` property a bit more and try to find useful cases where it can be used
